    "2. **Hyperbolic Tangent Function (tanh):** tanh(x) = {e^{x} - e^{-x}}/{e^{x} + e^{-x}} - Similar to the sigmoid but outputs values between -1 and 1, often used in hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):** f(x) = max(0, x) - Outputs the input for positive values and zero for negative values. It is widely used in hidden layers due to its simplicity and efficiency in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leaky ReLU:** f(x) = max(alpha x, x) - A variation of ReLU that allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative values (\\(alpha) is a small positive constant).\n",

    "5. **Parametric ReLU (PReLU):** f(x) = max(alpha x, x) - Similar to Leaky ReLU, but the slope (alpha) is a learnable parameter.\n",

    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. Their impact can be observed in terms of convergence speed, model stability, and the network's ability to learn and generalize from data. Here are some key ways in which activation functions affect neural network training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introducing Non-Linearity:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in data. Without non-linear activation functions, the entire neural network would behave like a linear model, limiting its capacity to capture intricate relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Flow and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:**\n",
    "   - During backpropagation, the gradient of the loss function is computed with respect to the network parameters. Activation functions influence the flow of gradients through the network. Some activation functions, like sigmoid and tanh, are prone to vanishing gradients (where gradients become extremely small) or exploding gradients (where gradients become very large). This can hinder or accelerate the learning process, affecting the stability of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Dead Neurons:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions like ReLU help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and are less likely to suffer from dead neurons (neurons that always output zero and do not contribute to learning). Dead neurons can arise when using activation functions with a limited output range.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence Speed:**\n",
    "   - The choice of activation function can impact the convergence speed of the training process. Some activation functions, such as ReLU, are computationally efficient and can lead to faster convergence. Faster convergence is desirable, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Expressiveness of the Model:**\n",
    "   - Different activation functions provide different levels of expressiveness to the model. For instance, ReLU and its variants allow the model to learn more complex representations, while sigmoid and tanh may constrain the model's capacity due to their limited output range.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Task-Specific Considerations:**\n",
    "   - The choice of activation function depends on the specific task at hand. For example, sigmoid is often used in the output layer for binary classification, while softmax is employed for multi-class classification. The choice of activation functions in hidden layers can also be task-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Robustness to Input Variations:**\n",
    "   - Some activation functions, like Leaky ReLU or ELU, introduce a level of robustness to variations in input data. This can help the model generalize better to unseen examples and improve performance on diverse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the selection of activation functions is a critical aspect of neural network design. It requires careful consideration based on the characteristics of the data and the specific requirements of the task. Researchers and practitioners often experiment with different activation functions and architectures to find the combination that yields optimal performance for a given problem."

    "\n",
    "\\[ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the sigmoid function works:\n",

    "- **Output Range:** The sigmoid function squashes its input values to the range of 0 to 1. As \\(x\\) becomes large and positive, \\(\\sigma(x)\\) approaches 1, and as \\(x\\) becomes large and negative, \\(\\sigma(x)\\) approaches 0.\n",

    "- **Smoothness:** The sigmoid function is smooth and differentiable everywhere, making it suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms like gradient descent during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sigmoid function has some notable advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Output Interpretability:** The output of the sigmoid function can be interpreted as a probability, which is useful for binary classification problems. It indicates the likelihood of the input belonging to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Smooth Gradient:** The sigmoid function has a smooth and continuous derivative, making it suitable for gradient-based optimization methods. This helps in the training process during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanishing Gradient:** One significant drawback of the sigmoid function is the vanishing gradient problem. As the input moves away from the origin in either direction, the gradient approaches zero. During backpropagation, this can result in very small weight updates, slowing down the learning process or even preventing it in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Saturation:** Sigmoid outputs are not zero-centered; they are in the range of 0 to 1. This can lead to issues during backpropagation because the gradients may be consistently positive or negative, affecting weight updates and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Zero-Centered:** The sigmoid function is not zero-centered, which can make optimization more challenging, especially in deeper networks where the gradients of the weights may consistently have the same sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these disadvantages, other activation functions like ReLU and its variants are often preferred in hidden layers of neural networks, especially in deep architectures, as they help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and accelerate training. Sigmoid is still commonly used in the output layer for binary classification tasks."

    "\n",
    "2. **Vanishing Gradient:** Unlike the sigmoid function, ReLU helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The derivative of ReLU is either 0 for negative inputs or 1 for positive inputs. This property allows for more effective weight updates during backpropagation.\n",

    "1. **Mitigation of Vanishing Gradient Problem:**\n",
    "   - One of the significant advantages of ReLU is its ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become very small during backpropagation, leading to slow or stalled learning.

    "   - ReLU doesn't suffer from saturation issues that sigmoid and tanh activations can encounter. Saturation occurs when the output is close to the extreme values (0 or 1), causing slow learning due to small gradients. ReLU, by design, does not saturate for positive inputs.\n",
